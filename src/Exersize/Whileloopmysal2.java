    warmup tasks:
            1. write a program that can divide two numbers.
    NOTE: DO NOT USE division, multiplication, or module operators

	2. write a program that can retunr the factorial number of any given number
    Ex:
    input: 5
    output: 120
    because:
            5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2* 1 = 120
